/**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * The goal of this program is to take a number in base 10 (as a string, of size less than uint64_t or equal to)
 * negative number are allowed as in the first character could be a '-', and you need to deal with that to print negative numbers.
 * The string "-", is valid and in our scheme is just the number 0.
 * The only three libraries allowed are stdio, stdint, stdlib
 * argv[1] = input
 *
 * After the assignment come up with two alternative schemes for packing strings and discuss in 1000 words the strengths and weaknesses of your approaches, vs
 * the current approach.
 * Be sure to cleanup the memory you use. (in other words leak checking is in the grading system.)

int main(int argc, char* argv[])

  //Ensure the input is exists.
  //Ensure the input is valid.
  //Parse the input
  //Print the output
  //Return -1 if an error occured, printing the error.
